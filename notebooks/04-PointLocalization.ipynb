    "The first step in the lecture towards the **vertical decompostion** was the **slab decomposition**. Essentially the problem is reduced to a one-dimensional problem, which can efficiently be solved using a balanced binary search tree. To reduce the problem we draw vertical lines through all vertices, which divides the instance into a set of vertical strips, also called slabs. Inside each strip there is a well-defined _bottom-to-top order_ on the line segments. Each strip is therefore a one dimensional problem in _y_-direction. If we know between which line segments of the strip our point is, we found the face of the subdivision containing the point. Finding the correct strip is also a one dimensional problem, this time in _x_-direction.\n",

    "The **vertical decomposition** or **trapezoidal map** $\\mathcal{T}$ is an improvement upon the slab decomposition. It uses less storage while maintaining the fast query time.\n",
    "We call two line segments _non-crossing_ if their intersection is either empty or a common endpoint. Vertical decompositions are defined on a set $S$ of $n$ non-corssing segments in the plane.\n",

    "The vertical decompostion is then similar to the slab decomposition. We draw a vertical extension through every vertex. The difference is that we stop at the next line segment and do not draw up to the bounding box.\n",

As described in [1, section 6.3] this can be done by using a symbolic shear transform.
