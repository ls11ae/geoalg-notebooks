    "The first step in the lecture towards the **vertical decompostion** was the **slab decomposition**. Essentially the problem is reduced to a one-dimensional problem, which can efficiently be solved using a balanced binary search tree. To reduce the problem we draw vertical lines through all vertices, which divides the instance into a set of vertical strips, also called slabs. Inside each strip there is a well-defined _bottom-to-top order_ on the line segments. Each strip is therefore a one dimensional problem in _y_-direction. If we know between which line segments of the strip our point is, we found the face of the subdivision containing the point. Finding the correct strip is also a one dimensional problem, this time in _x_-direction.\n",

As described in [1, section 6.3] this can be done by using a symbolic shear transform.

    "The reason for this is that the order in which the line segments are added changes the search structure, specifically it's depth.\n",
    "Therefore, some ordering could lead to good query times, while other ones lead to bad query times.\n",
    "Instead of finding an suitable ordering we use random ordering, which leads to acceptable running times.\n",
    "Here we introduce the randomization by shuffling the list of line segments. The seed is fixed so the algorithm works deterministic,\n",
    "but the seed can be changed or even set to <tt>None</tt> at the top where the <tt>VisualistionTool</tt> is created.\n",
    "After the segments are shuffled, they are incrementally inserted into our data structure. The procedure was already described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The construction algorithm is then registered in our <tt>VisualistionTool</tt>. The construction algorithm uses $O(n\\;\\text{log}\\; n)$ expected time to construct a data structure which uses $O(n)$ expected storage. [1, section 6.2]"
