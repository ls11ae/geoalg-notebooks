For example, checking if 3 points are on a line is the same as checking if the dual lines of those points all intersect in a single point.\n",

    "Once we have found a line-edge intersection we need to follow the line through the arrangement. From the previous step we either have a Vertex or an Edge and a Point on that Edge. If the line intersected and Edge we are good to go, we move to the twin of the edge and have found the face that gets split by the Line. But if the Line happens to go through an already existing Vertex we now need to find which of the faces adjacent to the vertex is one we will need to split.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the correct face we will use the two methods below. The *point_between_edge_and_next* method checks if a point is in the cone spanned by an edge and the next edge in the cycle. If the point is in the given cone, this also means that any line from the vertex to that point must also split the face between the edges. In the *find_leaving_edge* method we then use this method to check every ingoing edge of the Vertex. Since the Line goes through the Vertex, we know it splits exactly two Faces around it, one of which we came from and the other being the next face we have to split. Since we know the Face we where at previously we just check if we found a different Face and only return the corresponding Edge in that case.\n",

    "The choice of Points given to the methods are also important. We need to make sure that the Points are from different sides of the Vertex, otherwise we can miss the correct Face. To make sure we always have Points on different sides of the Vertex we move the two Points that make up the frame outside the window. This way it is guaranteed that one point will be left or above the vertex while the other is right or below."
