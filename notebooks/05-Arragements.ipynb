    "**Duality** is an alternative approach to think about points and lines, representing one as the other. This allows to use algorithms that solve problems on lines to also slove problems on points and vice versa. For example, if 3 points are on a line, the dual lines of those points all intersect in a single point. So checking if 3 points are on a line is equivalent to checking if 3 lines intersect in a single point\n",

    "An **Arangement** $\\mathcal{A}$ is a subdivision of the plane induced by a set $L$ of lines. It has vertices (intersection of the lines of $L$), edges (segments of the lines of $L$) and faces (area inbetween the lines of $L$).\n",

    "Many problems on a set of points can be solved by first transforming those points into lines and then bulding an Arragement on them.\n",

But if the Line happens to go through an already existing Vertex we now need to find which of the faces adjacent to the vertex is one we will need to split.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the correct face we will use the two methods below. The *point_between_edge_and_next* method checks if a point is in the cone spanned by an edge and the next edge in the cycle. If the point is in the given cone, this also means that any line from the vertex to that point must also split the face between the edges. In the *find_leaving_edge* method we then use this method to check every ingoing edge of the Vertex. Since the Line goes through the Vertex, we know it splits exactly two Faces around it, one of which we came from and the other being the next face we have to split. Since we know the Face we where at previously we just check if we found a different Face and only return the corresponding Edge in that case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of Points given to the methods are also important. We need to make sure that the Points are from different sides of the Vertex, otherwise we can miss the correct Face. To make sure we always have Points on different sides of the Vertex we move the two Points that make up the frame outside the window. This way it is guaranteed that one point will be left or above the vertex while the other is right or below."

    "Now that we went over Duality and Arrangements in detail, lets look at some examples where one or both can be used to solve problems easier than with a classical approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first example is an algorithm that takes a set of points and checks if any three points within that set are on a line. First off all, lets remember that since our points use float coordinates, they will never be exactly on a line, so we will have to use an epsilon inequalities. A simple algorithm would then calculate a line between 2 points and see if any of the other points is on that line. This has a worst-case runtime of $O(N^3)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But with duality, we can solve the problem much faster. The dual formulation of this problem is: Are there three lines that intersect in the same point. To calculate this we will calculate the Arrangement on the dual lines and stop once the same Vertex is intersected by three lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "For inner vertices, every line going through that vertex will generate two edges, so any Vertex with more than four edges is relevant. For outer edges we have two edges from the start, those generated by the bounding box, but every line going through the vertex only adds one additional edge. So we again have to stop once we have five or more edge attached to a vertex. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is very similar to the Arragement from before, but has added checks to see if newly created edges are lead to the vertex having five or more edges total. When such a vertex is found, the vertex and points corresponding to the intersecting lines are highlighted."
