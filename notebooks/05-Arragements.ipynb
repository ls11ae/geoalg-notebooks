    "**Duality** is an alternative approach to think about points and lines, representing one as the other. This allows to use algorithms that solve problems on lines to also slove problems on points and vice versa. For example, if 3 points are on a line, the dual lines of those points all intersect in a single point. So checking if 3 points are on a line is equivalent to checking if 3 lines intersect in a single point\n",

    "An **Arangement** $\\mathcal{A}$ is a subdivision of the plane induced by a set $L$ of lines. It has vertices (intersection of the lines of $L$), edges (segments of the lines of $L$) and faces (area inbetween the lines of $L$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many problems on a set of points can be solved by first transforming those points into lines and then bulding an Arragement on them.\n",

    "We will first go over duality and some examples to make the concept and look at Arrangments afterwards. Lastly we will look at some applications of Duality to solve certain problems."

    "Once we have found a line-edge intersection we need to follow the line through the arrangement. From the previous step we either have a Vertex or an Edge and a Point on that Edge. If the line intersected and Edge we are good to go, we move to the twin of the edge and have found the face that gets split by the Line. But if the Line happens to go through an already existing Vertex we now need to find which of the faces adjacent to the vertex is one we will need to split.\n",

If the point is in the given cone, this also means that any line from the vertex to that point must also split the face between the edges. In the *find_leaving_edge* method we then use this method to check every ingoing edge of the Vertex. Since the Line goes through the Vertex, we know it splits exactly two Faces around it, one of which we came from and the other being the next face we have to split. Since we know the Face we where at previously we just check if we found a different Face and only return the corresponding Edge in that case.\n",

To make sure we always have Points on different sides of the Vertex we move the two Points that make up the frame outside the window. This way it is guaranteed that one point will be left or above the vertex while the other is right or below."
