    "This chapter contains two connected topics, **Duality** and **Arrangements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duality** is an alternative approach to think about points and lines, representing one as the other. This allows us to use algorithms, that solve problems on lines, to also solve problems on points and vice versa. For example, if 3 points are on a line, the dual lines of those points all intersect in a single point. So checking if 3 points are on a line is equivalent to checking if 3 lines intersect in a single point\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Arrangement** $\\mathcal{A}$ is a subdivision of the plane induced by a set $L$ of lines. It has vertices (intersection of the lines of $L$), edges (segments of the lines of $L$) and faces (area in-between the lines of $L$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many problems on a set of points can be solved by first transforming those points into lines and then building the Arrangement on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook will first give an introduction to Duality to make the concept clear and go over Arrangements afterward. Lastly, we will look at some example applications of Duality that use Arrangements to solve otherwise difficult problems much faster."

    " - A **point** $p = (x, y)$ becomes the line $p^* := p_x x - p_y$. $p*$ is then called the dual of $p$.\n",

    "- Self inverse: When Transforming an object $x$ into its dual $x^*$, the dual $x^{**}$ of $x^*$ is the original object $x$ again.\n",
    "- Vertical distances are preserved: Given a point $p$ and a line $l$ that are a vertical distance $m$ apart, the duals $p^*$ and $l^*$ are also a vertical distance $m$ apart.\n",
    "- Relative positions are inverted: Given a point $p$ that is below/on/above a line $l$, the dual line $p^*$ is above/through/below the dual point $l^*$\n",
    "- Intersections: If two lines $l_1, l_2$ intersect in a point $p$, the dual line $p^*$ of the point will go through the dual points $l^*_1, l^*_2$ of the lines\n",
    "- Collinear: Given three points $p_1, p_2, p_3$ on a line $l$, the dual lines $p_1^*, p_2^*, p_3^*$ will all intersect in the dual point $l^*$\n",

In the *find_leaving_edge* method, we use this method to check every ingoing edge of the Vertex. Since the Line goes through the Vertex, we know it splits exactly two faces around it, one of which we came from and the other being the next face we have to split.

    "# 5. Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will go over two examples that use duality to find more efficient solutions to problems than a classical approach. The examples are *3 Points on a Line* and *Min Area Triangle*, which are taken from the lecture but were not explored in detail there.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1 Three Points on a Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first example is an algorithm that takes a set of points and checks if any three points within that set are on a line. First, let's remember that since our points use float coordinates, they will never be exactly on a line, so we will have to use epsilon inequalities. A simple algorithm would calculate a line between every pair of points and see if any of the other points is on that line, but this would have a worst-case runtime of $O(N^3)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With duality, we can solve the problem much faster. The dual formulation of this problem is: Are there three lines that intersect in the same point. To calculate this, we will calculate the Arrangement of the dual lines and stop once the same Vertex is intersected by three lines. Since an Arrangement only has complexity of $O(n^2)$, this is much faster than the classical approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "To know when to stop, let's see how adding a new line impacts the number of edges. For vertices that are no on the bounding box, every line going through that vertex will generate two edges, so if a Vertex has more than four edges, there are at least three Lines intersecting in that Vertex. Vertices on the bounding box start with two edges from the bounding box, but every Line going through those vertices only generates one edge. This means that, as with inner vertices, any outer vertex that has four or more edges is intersected by three lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is very similar to the Arrangement from before, but has added checks to see if newly created edges lead to the vertex having five or more edges total. When such a vertex is found, the algorithm terminates and the vertex as well as the points corresponding to the intersecting lines are highlighted."
