    "**Duality** is an alternative approach to think about points and lines, representing one as the other. This allows to use algorithms for one problem on one on the problems for the other. For example, checking if 3 points are on a line is the same as checking if the dual lines of those points all intersect in a single point.\n",

    "\n",
    "The outer edges and faces of an Arrangement are unbounded. For edges this happens because the lines that make the edge have some last intersection with the other lines of $L$. The edge after that intersection has no other endpoint. The outer faces are also unbounded as they have no additional line limiting their size.\n",

This adds additional vertices where the lines intersect with the bounding box. We also get new edges as the boundary of the box becomes part of the DCEL.\n",

Since the vertices of $\\mathcal{A}(L)$ are just the intersection points of the lines in $L$, what we actually need to find are the maximum and minimum x and y coordinate of the intersections. Then we can use them as cornerpoints for an axis alinged box that contains all vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the intersection we points we could use a linesweep algorithm, but in this case we will just go with a bruteforce Algorithm that runs in quadratic time. In theory this is super easy, but in pratice we need to be careful with special cases. The steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First we need to find all Intersections between the lines. For this we just use a bruteforce approach by checking all possible combinations of lines\n",
